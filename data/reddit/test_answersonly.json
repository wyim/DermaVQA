Onset of the rash, history of fever, presence of any medical condition, drug history, history of recent travelling, or contact with other people or animals should be demonstrated. Depending on the course of your rash and your history, the doctor may order a blood or urine test. The doctor may also do a skin biopsy and refer you to a skin disease specialist. For immediate treatment to relieve itching, your doctor may also prescribe antihistamines or topical steroids. You can also use over-the-counter drugs such as hydrocortisone creams. If it is a drug reaction, the doctor will have you stop the medication and try a substitute, if necessary. If the cause of the rash is a viral infection or a bacterial infection, you will be treated for the particular disease.",

However, they can sometimes indicate a more severe medical condition and may warrant closer inspection. There is no cure for telangiectasia, but it is treatable. Laser therapy is minimally invasive and is typically the most straightforward treatment for telangiectasia and broken capillaries. Laser ablation can seal the widened blood vessels. This procedure does not cause much pain, and the recovery time is short. Sclerotherapy is also an effective option where a solution is injected into the veins causing inflammation and hence shrinkage of the veins.",

A bland emollient without preservatives/additives can be used for skin dryness. Avoid occlusive creams and ointments as they can worsen the case. A gel or liquid sunscreen can be used.

Alternate the shoes you wear each day, if possible, to ensure shoes are dry when they are put on. Topical anti-itch medication, emollients like urea and petrolatum, and steroid creams may help reduce itching localized on the skin surface. The mainstay of treatment is the use of an occlusive, soothing ointment (containing Dimethicone) that is applied to the affected areas of the foot immediately after shoe removal or emersion from a water source. The ointment keeps the plantar surfaces of the feet from drying out too rapidly.

Most probably it's a case of Ringworm especially if the lesion was itchy. It is a fungal infection that is very contagious so it's important to use the right antifungal medicine as long as you can (around 2 weeks) to ensure that the ringworm does not reappear a few weeks after you stop treating it. After touching the area with ringworm, wash your hands before touching another area of your body. Ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas, so you want to keep the area clean and dry. Avoid wearing clothes, socks, and shoes that make you sweat. Shower after working out and avoid sharing towels and other personal items. To avoid re-infecting yourself with infected items, you should wash clothes, towels, and bedding that you use while you have ringworm. Be sure to wash everything in hot, soapy water. If you suspect your pet has ringworm, take the animal to your vet as some types of ringworms grow on pets. Topical antifungal cream (azoles group like Miconazole or clotrimazole) twice daily for 2-4 weeks is recommended and systemic antifungal may be prescribed by your dermatologist if resistant to treatment. Granuloma annulare is sometimes mistaken with tinea corporis but the lack of any surface changes like scales to the skin is the key feature that distinguishes granuloma annulare from other skin conditions. It is a benign self-limited condition with unknown cause. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended for close inspection of the lesion if it's scaly or not.",

You can avoid this condition by not removing hair or not shaving very close to the skin. If that's not an option, use these tips to make ingrown hair less likely:\nBefore shaving wash your skin with warm water and a mild facial cleanser. Apply lubricating shaving cream or gel a few minutes before shaving, to soften the hair, or apply a warm, damp cloth. Use a sharp, single-blade razor, this helps avoid a too-close shave. Don't pull your skin while shaving and shave in the direction of hair growth. Rinse the blade after each stroke and rinse your skin. Apply a cool wet cloth for about five minutes, then use a soothing after-shave product or a glycolic acid lotion to help remove dead skin cells (exfoliate). Try a different hair removal method, such as hair removal cream, or try a long-term way of removing hair, such as laser treatment. Apply topical steroid cream and topical antiseptic lotion.",

Also, very tight-fitting shoes can put pressure on the blood vessels and cause leakage. Failure to identify and repair an acute nail bed defect in a timely fashion may result in less than satisfactory nail plate regeneration. This would be due to the formation of a nail bed scar that prevents plate adherence to the bed and the subsequent development of onycholysis of the newly formed nail plate.  Minor nail bed injuries, including subungual hematomas, often heal on their own, especially when no other injuries are present. People with nail bed injuries may need a course of antibiotics to prevent infection. Also, the doctor may check on the status of their tetanus injections and request an X-ray to check for any bone fractures. No treatment is required for subungual haemorrhage in the majority of cases. In the case of repetitive subungual haemorrhage, precipitating factors should be avoided, such as tight or ill-fitting shoes. Occasionally the nail plate is best removed, and the nailbed surgically repaired.

There are many skin conditions that may lead to itchy skin and excoriations like dry skin (xerosis), insect bites, allergic dermatitis, eczema, infections or psychogenic causes. It's important to avoid scratching your itchy legs, as this may cause further damage to the skin and can make the area feel even more sensitive. Sometimes, having extremely itchy legs can alert you to an underlying health condition. If you have chronic and intense itchy legs that are not relieved by removing allergens, changing moisturizers, or keeping the skin hydrated, you should see a healthcare professional. If your primary healthcare provider is unable to diagnose the cause of your itchy legs, they may refer you to a dermatologist. Theses simple steps can relieve your itching like using aloe vera with its anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe itchy skin, hot water dries out the skin, use lukewarm or cool water instead, moisturize skin daily preferably after a shower or before bed, take an oatmeal bath, and try a cold compress. You can also try over the counter treatment like second-generation antihistamines—like Allegra (fexofenadine), Claritin (loratadine), or Zyrtec (cetirizine)—for daytime itchiness, topical moisturizers containing ceramides and topical hydrocortisone cream.",

Before shaving, apply a pre-shave gel and apply a fragrance-free shaving cream. Shave in the direction that your hair grows and rinse with lukewarm water. Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel; leave your skin a little damp, this helps your skin retain moisture and apply a moisturizer formulated for your skin type.

To soothe heat or itching, apply a cool washcloth to the affected area to calm your skin. Aloe or avocado oil are both cooling and can be safely applied directly to the skin. To minimize your risk of developing any infection at the barber's, make sure to cancel your appointment if you have any open or raw skin, which can increase your risk of developing an infection.

One tip is that if the fingernails split, but the toenails are strong, then an external factor is the cause. Basically brittle nails can be divided into dry and brittle (too little moisture) and soft and brittle (often too much moisture).\nThe usual cause is repeated wetting and drying of the fingernails. This makes them dry and brittle. This is often worse in low humidity and in the winter (dry heat). The best treatment is to apply lotions containing alpha-hydroxy acids or lanolin containing lotions to the nails after first soaking nails in water for 5 minutes. Wearing gloves when performing household chores that involve getting the hands wet is very helpful in preventing brittle nails. Cotton lined rubber gloves can be purchased in stores. If soft, consider that the nails may be getting too much moisture or being damaged by chemicals such as detergents, cleaning fluids and nail polish removers (the acetone containing removers are somewhat worse than acetone free). Be gentle to your nails. Shape and file the nails with a very fine file and round the tips in a gentle curve. Daily filing of snags or irregularities helps to prevent further breakage or splitting. Avoid metal instruments on the nail surface to push back the cuticle. If the nails are \"buffed\" do this in the same direction as the nail grows and not in a \"back and forth\" motion because this can cause nail splitting. Biotin (a vitamin) taken by mouth is beneficial in some people. Get the \"Biotin ultra\" 1 mg. size as it also comes as much smaller pills and take 2 or 3 a day. It takes at least 6 months, but does really help at least 1/3 of the time. Do not take this if you are pregnant.

Injury to the skin is a common trigger (the pathergic response), and a surgical trigger is well-known, and often misinterpreted as a wound infection. Treatment is usually successful in arresting the process, but complete healing may take months. Pyoderma gangrenosum is diagnosed by its characteristic appearance and severe pain. The pathergy test is usually positive (a skin prick test causing a papule, pustule, or ulcer). The wound should be swabbed and cultured for microorganisms, but these are not the cause of pyoderma gangrenosum. A biopsy may be necessary to rule out other causes of ulceration. Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is mainly non-surgical. The necrotic tissue should be gently removed. Wide surgical debridement should be avoided during the active stage of pyoderma gangrenosum because it may result in enlargement of the ulcer. Skin grafting and other surgical procedures may be performed when the active disease phase has settled, with care to minimize trauma. Referral to a dermatologist to prescribe potent topical steroid ointment, tacrolimus ointment, intralesional steroid injections into the ulcer edge, ciclosporin solution, special dressings, oral anti-inflammatory antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline.

However, you don’t have to quit exercising in order to see clearer skin. The key is to maintain proper hygiene before, during, and after your workouts. Before you work out, put on clean workout clothes (washed since you last wore them) as dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils on unwashed clothes can clog your pores, leading to acne. To remove sweat during a workout, use a clean towel and gently pat the sweat from your skin. Avoid sharing protective equipment like helmets and shoulder pads whenever possible. Consider showering immediately after your workout. This may rinse away bacteria that can cause acne. A mild, oil-free cleanser can remove bacteria that can lead to acne and prevent clogged pores without irritating your skin. If you aren’t able to shower, consider changing out of your workout clothes and wiping skin that tends to break out with pads that contain salicylic acid, this can prevent clogged pores. If you still have breakouts after trying these tips, your sports equipment or clothing might be to blame. Everything from football helmets to synthetic dance clothes can cause acne. Trade tight-fitting workout clothes for loose-fitting ones. Using an acne medication with salicylic acid often works well to clear this type of acne. Salicylic acid helps unclog pores. You’ll find acne treatment that contains salicylic acid in stores and online, no prescription needed.",

Worsening occurs when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin you can treat it with moisturizers and prescription creams to help improve how the skin looks. Creams to remove dead skin cells like creams containing alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, or urea help loosen and remove dead skin cells. They also moisturize and soften dry skin. For best results, apply your moisturizer after every shower or bath, within 5 minutes of getting out of the bath or shower, while your skin is still damp. At least 2 or 3 times a day, gently massaging it into the skin. You can also use topical retinoid creams to help unclog follicles and promote cell turnover. Some patients may need to apply a corticosteroid to the areas with keratosis pilaris. This medicine helps soften the bumps and reduce redness. Lasers may work when moisturizers and medicine fail. Using medicated cream regularly may improve how the skin looks. But if you stop, the condition returns. And even with treatment, keratosis pilaris might last for years.",

Using two or more types of treatment often improves results. Injections of corticosteroids or another medication, keloid surgery, silicone gel sheets may help flatten keloids, freezing (cryosurgery), or laser treatment. Tattoos, body piercing, or cosmetic procedures all injure the skin, which means you could develop a keloid afterward if you’re prone to getting keloids. The best way to prevent a keloid is to skip the body art and cosmetic procedures. If you’re concerned that a cosmetic procedure may cause a keloid, tell your dermatologist or other doctor who will perform the procedure.

If your scalp is dry and itchy and you see flakes on your hair or clothing, you may have dandruff. Leaving some shampoo on your scalp can also irritate it.  An itchy scalp is the most common symptom of head lice, too. If you suspect that head lice are causing the itch, ask someone to closely examine your scalp and hair for signs of these tiny bugs. Seborrheic dermatitis is also a possible cause for this itching if you have oily and greasy flakes. Severe itching usually results in scalp injury and probably secondary infection (folliculitis) which is the case here. Treatment of the cause of itchy scalp is the mainstay for preventing folliculitis. Anti-dandruff shampoos are essential where people with straight or wavy hair usually shampoo every day while curly or tightly coiled hair are likely to shampoo once a week. Shampoo containing 2% zinc pyrithione, 1% ketoconazole, or 1% selenium sulfide is recommended and sometimes topical hydrocortisone creams or lotions are needed. To get seborrheic dermatitis under control, it’s important to leave the shampoo on your scalp for 5-10 minutes, this gives the medication time to work. You also want to thoroughly rinse off the shampoo. Skin with seborrheic dermatitis is easily irritated. If you have shampoo residue on your skin or scalp, it could cause a flare-up. You need to get rid of the lice if it is the cause of itching. For folliculitis, you can also try topical antibiotic cream (e.g. fusidic acid gel), clindamycin solution, erythromycin solution, mild topical steroid lotions or creams, oral antihistamines, oral antibiotics, particularly long-term tetracycline, oral isotretinoin – long-term low dose treatment may be required.

Prescription antiviral medicine or creams (Acyclovir (Zovirax), Valacyclovir (Valtrex), Famciclovir, Penciclovir (Denavir)) can help sores heal more quickly. And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious. Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present. The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid. Avoid sharing items. Utensils, towels, lip balm, and other personal items can spread the virus when blisters are present.
