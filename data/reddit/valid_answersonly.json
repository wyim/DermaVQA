Although it is not considered infectious in the conventional sense, pityriasis versicolor sometimes affects more than one member of a family.Mild pityriasis versicolor is treated with topical antifungal agents. Selenium sulfide shampoo, Topical azole cream/shampoo (econazole, ketoconazole), Terbinafine gel. The medicine should be applied widely to the skin from the jawline down and left on the skin for 5-15 minutes before rinsing off in the shower. This should be done daily for one week then weekly for one month. Oral antifungal agents, itraconazole and fluconazole, are used to treat pityriasis versicolor when extensive or if topical agents have failed. Vigorous exercise an hour after taking the medication may help sweat it onto the skin surface, where it can effectively eradicate the yeast. Bathing should be avoided for a few hours. A few days treatment will clear many cases of pityriasis long term, or at least for several months. Reapplication of a topical treatment such as selenium sulfide shampoo every month once the rash has cleared will usually prevent recurrence.",

For best results, apply your moisturizer after every shower or bath, within 5 minutes of getting out of the bath or shower, while your skin is still damp. At least 2 or 3 times a day, gently massage it into the skin. You can also use topical retinoid creams to help unclog follicles and promote cell turnover. Some patients may need to apply a corticosteroid to the areas with keratosis pilaris. This medicine helps soften the bumps and reduce redness. Lasers may work when moisturizer and medicine fail. Using medicated cream regularly may improve how the skin looks. But if you stop, the condition returns. And even with treatment, keratosis pilaris might last for years.",

Psoriasis, including scalp psoriasis, is thought to be caused and affected by a combination of genetic, immune, hormonal, and environmental factors.

Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself.
